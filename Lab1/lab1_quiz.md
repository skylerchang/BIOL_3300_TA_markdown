 True
 False

 All of the above

cp /home/Biol3300/Test /home/Biol3300/new_file.txt
cp ../new_file.txt /home/Biol3300/Test
cp /home/Biol3300/new_file.txt ../Test


### What command can you use to create two files named temp1 and temp2 in Temp/ (Assume you are not in the Temp/ directory, but the directory that contains Temp/?)
